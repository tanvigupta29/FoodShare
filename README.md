# FoodShare
The Food Share Platform connects donors with recipients to reduce food waste and hunger. Donors post surplus food with location details, and recipients claim items via an interactive map. Features include secure login, dashboards, real-time updates, and optional SMS alerts, promoting community sharing and sustainability.
